            p SoundScry is a place where you can invest in a band’s album and then use your network to promote the band and share in the revenues.
            ul Here is how you get involved:
                li Check out the bands on the site by looking at Active Offerings. Listen to the music. If you think the band has some potential, then purchase shares of the band.
                li Start promoting the band to your online and offline networks.
                li You will be paid a percentage of the proceeds (determined by the number of shares you own) from music and merchandising purchases made through the SoundScry platform
            p Example
            .well
                ul
                    li The band offers 50% of their new album for $5,000
                    li You buy $50 of the Offering (1%)
                    li You and other investors start to promote the band through your networks
                    li 10,000 albums are sold for $10 each bringing in $100,000
                    li After our 15% commission the band and the investors will split $85,000, 50/50 or $42,500 to the band and $42,500 to be split among the Investors
                    li In this case you would receive 1% of the $42,500 or $425.
                    li: i  Not bad for the 1% investment
            ul For any merchandise being offered you will receive your % split of the Profits
                li Profits defined as the difference between the “selling price” and “cost to make, i.e. $15 selling price - $7.50 cost to make =$7.50 which is split 50% musician/50% investors or $3.75/$3.75 minus SoundScry commission
