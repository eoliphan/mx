==== widget code (html code) =======

This is standard html code.
For the clarity of the projet, this code was isolated in this separated html file.
This file will be dynamically loaded by jQuery ($.load, see http://api.jquery.com/load/).
If you don't like dynamic load, you can copy/paste this code (actually it is just html code) anywhere you want to use it.
