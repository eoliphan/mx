==== wTime & wServerCommand widgets (html code) =======

This is standard html code.
For the clarity of the projet, this code was isolated in this separated html file.
This file will be dynamically loaded by jQuery ($.load, see http://api.jquery.com/load/).
If you don't like dynamic load, you can copy/paste this code (actually it is just html code) anywhere you want to use it.

<div id="wTime" class="mojitoPanel">
	<span id="wTimeHour"></span> :
	<span id="wTimeMinute"></span> :
	<span id="wTimeSecond"></span>
</div>

<div id="wServerCommand" class="mojitoPanel mojitoPanel-dark">
	<button class="btn btn-mini" data-placement="right" data-title="Server command to deploy to the staging server"><i class="icon-refresh"></i> Staging deployment</button><br />
	<button class="btn btn-mini" data-placement="right" data-title="Server command to deploy to the production server"><i class="icon-refresh"></i> Production deployment</button><br />
